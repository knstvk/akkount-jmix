name: jmix-verify-api-symbol
description: Before typing a class, enum constant, inner-class event, method, or icon name you have not personally verified in this project, confirm it exists. Costs seconds and prevents the most expensive class of failures (hallucinated icon constants, fake event inner classes, wrong package paths). Primary check when connected = the Context7 docs MCP (/jmix-framework/jmix-context7); falls back to grepping the project for a working example or an IDE symbol search.

# Verify API symbols before you type them

A top cause of failed runs is confidently typed API names that do not exist —
they look right, survive typing, then break compile or, worse, at render time.
This is a seconds-long pre-flight check. Run it BEFORE writing any symbol you
have not already seen in this project's source tree.

## When to run

Before typing any of:

- A Vaadin enum constant (e.g. a `VaadinIcon.X`)
- A class qualified by a guessed package ("is `Dialogs` in `io.jmix.flowui` or
  `io.jmix.flowui.dialogs`?")
- An event inner class ("does `JmixButton.ClickEvent` exist, or is it
  `com.vaadin.flow.component.ClickEvent<JmixButton>`?")
- A builder-style method ("`.withEntity()` or `.editEntity()` on
  `DialogWindows.detail(...)`?")
- A Jmix action type id or a security-role enum constant you have not used yet

Skip it only when you can point at the same exact symbol already in use in this
project's `src/`.

## How to verify — MCP first, floor always

**Free short-circuit:** if the EXACT symbol is already used in this project's
`src/`, copy that call site — it is ground truth, no lookup needed:

```bash
grep -rn "DialogWindows" src/main/java --include='*.java'
grep -rn "VaadinIcon\." src/main --include='*.xml' --include='*.java'
```

For anything NOT already in the project, verify it before you type it:

1. **Context7 — PRIMARY when connected.** Query the Context7 docs MCP with the
   Jmix library id `/jmix-framework/jmix-context7` for the exact symbol (a class,
   an `StandardOutcome` constant, the `DialogWindows.detail(...).editEntity(...)`
   shape, valid `@Install(subject=...)` names, `io.jmix.flowui.Dialogs` vs raw
   Vaadin `Dialog`). It resolves the API from the official Jmix docs — your best
   check for a symbol new to the project.

2. **IDE symbol search — if available.** Confirm the class/constant exists and read
   its fully-qualified name and members to settle package guesses and whether a
   constant or inner type exists.

3. **`javap` on the dependency jars — the fallback that always works.** It prints
   the real members and signatures from the compiled classes, and it is the only
   check left for a symbol with **zero call sites in the project** (step 4 has
   nothing to grep).

   ```bash
   CP=$(find ~/.gradle/caches -name '*.jar' ! -name '*sources*' | tr '\n' ':')
   javap -p -cp "$CP" io.jmix.flowui.Dialogs
   ```

   Every cached jar on one classpath, so you need not know which artifact owns the
   class (`-p` also lists non-public members). If the cache holds several versions
   and a signature looks wrong, check which one the build resolves.

4. **Floor: grep a known-good example and reuse only what is actually there.**
   Find a real call site in the wider codebase or a reference app and copy its
   exact shape — useful when the symbol IS used somewhere, but blind when it is
   new to the project (use step 3 then).

Never invent and ship. If nothing confirms a symbol, do not type it — pick one you
CAN confirm, or omit the optional decoration (e.g. drop an icon attribute rather
than guess a constant).

## A close-but-not-exact doc example still confirms the symbol

When the fetched example differs from what you need only on a **plain Java or JPA**
axis — an abstract vs concrete base class, one field more or less, another property
type — it has already confirmed the API. Stop querying for a closer match.

Keep verifying only when the difference IS the Jmix API: another method name,
another package, another annotation member. Then use `javap` (step 3).

## The recurring garbage list

Symbols commonly invented. NEVER type these — verify first:

| You might type                                       | Reality                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| an invented `VaadinIcon` constant                    | does not exist; the icon enum is small and irregular — pick from existing constants or omit |
| `JmixButton.ClickEvent`                              | use `com.vaadin.flow.component.ClickEvent<JmixButton>`       |
| `DataGrid.ReadEvent`, `DataGrid.SelectionEvent`      | use `com.vaadin.flow.data.selection.SelectionEvent<DataGrid<E>, E>` |
| `Target.DATA_GRID`                                   | not a Jmix `@Subscribe` target — use `Target.COMPONENT` with explicit id |
| `io.jmix.flowui.dialogs.Dialogs`                     | actual: `io.jmix.flowui.Dialogs`                             |
| `io.jmix.core.entity.EntityStates`                   | actual: `io.jmix.core.EntityStates`                          |
| `io.jmix.flowui.component.datagrid.DataGrid`         | actual: `io.jmix.flowui.component.grid.DataGrid`             |
| `io.jmix.flowui.component.markdown.Markdown`         | actual: `com.vaadin.flow.component.markdown.Markdown` — the `<markdown>` component is Vaadin's; `io.jmix.flowui` has a DIFFERENT `markdowneditor` component |
| `dialogs.createDetailView(this, entity, View.class)` | use `dialogWindows.detail(this, EntityClass.class).editEntity(entity).withViewClass(View.class)` |
| `dataGrid.addItemChangeListener(...)`                | use `addSelectionListener(...)` or `asSingleSelect().addValueChangeListener(...)` |
| `dataGrid.getSingleSelected()`                       | use `getSingleSelectedItem()`                                |

## Cost vs benefit

A verification check takes ~1 second; a failed `compileJava` cycle costs
15–30 seconds plus error-log parsing, and a passed compile that fails at render
time in a UI test costs the whole test run. The break-even is one prevented
failure per session — run the check: Context7 if connected, else `javap` on the
dependency jars (step 3), else grep a known-good call site (step 4); never ship an
unverified symbol.
